    "# Week 3 Day 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Google Colab - using free and powerful compute in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab gives you a remote Notebook-style browser window on to a machine, and you run code \"locally\" on that machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Free access to T4 GPUs!\n",
    "2. Easy ability to share code and collaborate on it\n",
    "3. Everyone gets to use identical code - no environment differences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downsides of Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As it's free, Google reserves the right to bump you off the box at any point (\"reset the runtime\"), and this happens most quickly if no code is running. They can also downgrade you from a T4 to a CPU-only box. Sometimes this happens silently. You need to start everything again from the top. Paid plans last longer.\n",
    "2. You need to pip install packages every single time (but no pip installs today)\n",
    "3. There's some latency - it's not as interactive as coding on your own box\n",
    "\n",
    "## Survival Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always start by pressing the drop down arrow by Connect on the top right, and \"Connect to a hosted runtime: T4\"\n",
    "2. From that dropdown, \"View Resources\" to check you have a GPU and monitor memory\n",
    "3. If things go awry, Runtime >> Disconnect and Delete Runtime, Connect again, and then run cells from the top\n",
    "4. Always run the pip installs! Ignore pip dependency errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime >> Restart session: this restarts the Python Kernel, but pip packages remain installed and the disk remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime >> Diconnect and delete session. This wipes everything."

    "# Connecting Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to log in to the HuggingFace hub if you've not done so before.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you haven't already done so, create a **free** HuggingFace account at https://huggingface.co and navigate to Settings from the user menu on the top right. Then Create a new API token, giving yourself write permissions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT** when you create your HuggingFace API key, please be sure to select WRITE permissions for your key by clicking on the WRITE tab, otherwise you may get problems later. Not \"fine-grained\" but \"write\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Back here in colab, press the \"key\" icon on the side panel to the left, and add a new secret:  \n",
    "  In the name field put `HF_TOKEN`  \n",
    "  In the value field put your actual token: `hf_...`  \n",
    "  Ensure the notebook access switch is turned ON.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Execute the cell below to log in. You'll need to do this on each of your colabs. It's a really useful way to manage your secrets without needing to type them into colab."
